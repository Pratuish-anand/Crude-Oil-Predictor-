The Crude Oil Price Predictor is an advanced forecasting project designed to estimate global crude oil prices for the next five decades, spanning 2025 to 2075. The aim of this project is to understand and quantify how long-term economic and policy-driven factors—specifically inflation, global economic challenges, and government policies—influence crude oil price trends. This predictive system assists industries, investors, and policymakers in making informed strategic decisions in an unpredictable global energy market.

Crude oil prices are shaped by a complex interplay of supply-demand economics, geopolitical tensions, inflationary pressures, and regulatory frameworks. To capture this complexity, the project uses historical datasets, including crude oil price records, consumer price indices, global GDP data, recession indicators, and policy archives from major oil-producing nations. These datasets are pre-processed and integrated into a unified analytical framework.

For forecasting, the system employs a combination of statistical time-series models (ARIMA, VAR), machine learning algorithms, and deep learning architectures such as LSTM networks. These models are trained to recognise long-term patterns, seasonal variations, and sudden market shocks. Scenario-based simulations are also incorporated to observe the possible outcomes under varying inflation rates, energy policy shifts, carbon taxation, renewable adoption, wars, and trade restrictions.

The project places special emphasis on three major influencing factors:

Inflation: How rising global inflation impacts production, transportation, and consumer demand for oil.

Economic Challenges: The role of recessions, financial instability, labour shortages, and shifting global growth patterns on oil consumption.

Government Policies: The effects of carbon neutrality goals, renewable energy investments, drilling restrictions, international sanctions, and OPEC decisions on long-term crude price behaviour.
